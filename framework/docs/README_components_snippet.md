# Components

Spectra components are **token-driven primitives**, not full UI systems.

They provide structure and consistency while leaving behavior to your application.

---

## Included Components

- Buttons
- Cards
- Forms
  - Inputs
  - Textarea
  - Select
  - Toggle / Switch
  - Checkbox
  - Radio
- Utilities

See `/framework/demos/` for live examples of every component.

---

## Component Rules

- No JavaScript required
- No layout assumptions
- No visual magic
- No hidden state

Components exist to be **combined**, not extended endlessly.
