# Utilities

Spectra utilities are intentionally minimal.

They exist only when a pattern appears repeatedly across components.

---

## Visibility

- `.sp-hidden` — removes element from layout
- `.sp-visually-hidden` — screen-reader only

---

## Text

- `.sp-muted`
- `.sp-subtle`
- `.sp-text-center`

---

## Spacing

Limited helpers only:

- `.sp-mt-2`, `.sp-mt-3`, `.sp-mt-4`
- `.sp-mb-2`, `.sp-mb-3`, `.sp-mb-4`

If you need more, reconsider layout.

---

## Layout

- `.sp-inline`
- `.sp-row`
- `.sp-control`

---

## Rule

If a utility is not broadly reusable, it does not belong here.
