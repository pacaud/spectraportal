# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve this project.

## Ground rules
- Keep changes focused and small when possible.
- Avoid committing secrets (API keys, tokens, `.env`, private URLs).
- Prefer clear commit messages.

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repo (or create a branch if you have access)
2. Create a feature branch:
   - `git checkout -b feature/your-change`
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests / build (if the project has them)
5. Open a Pull Request with:
   - what you changed
   - why you changed it
   - screenshots (for UI changes)

## Code style
- Match the existing style in the repo.
- If formatting tools exist, please run them before opening a PR.
